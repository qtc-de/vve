1. Intro                                                  *vveIntro*

What is vve?

  vve is shorthand for various vim encoders and adds encoding
  capabilities to the Vim editor. Simple encoding tasks like
  encoding a portion of text to Base64 format can be done by
  invoking simple key mappings. Additionally, it adds certain
  utility functions that are not really encoding related.

How can vve help me?

  Encoding or decoding text is a quite common task during
  security assessments and there are many possibilities to get
  the job done. Encoding or decoding text directly in Vim is
  one of the fastest possibilities that fits perfectly in my own
  workflow. If you are familiar with Vim and love its quick
  and flexible editing capabilities, you will also love vve.

How do I use it?

  vve is build according to the typical structure of a Vim plugin.
  You can install it either by using Vims native package manager
  or using one of the several available third party package
  managers. After installation, vve adds certain keybindings to
  your editor. All start with your <leader> key and can be
  invoked either in normal or visual mode. See |vveGlobalMappings|
  for more details.

Limitations

  Decoding text inside of an editor is of course limited to
  displayable characters. If you decode a portion of text that
  translates to non UTF-8 formatted data, vve will probably fail.
  In these situations you can use the |:ChangeEncoding| command
  or decoding to ASCII instead of UTF-8. More details can be found
  in the |vveUnprintable| section.

2. Functionality provided                         *vveFunctionality*

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Global Commands                             *vveGlobalCommands*

:InsertFile                                            *:InsertFile*
    Just inserts the basename of the specified file. The idea
    behind this function is that you may want to insert the name
    of a file, but do not remember the exact filename. This
    command has file autocompletion available on the command
    prompt and allows you to search for your file. After hitting
    enter, the basename of the file will be inserted.

:AppendFile                                            *:AppendFile*
    Same as |:InsertFile|, but it appends the filename after the
    cursor instead of inserting in front of it.

:InsertPath                                            *:InsertPath*
    Same as |:InsertFile|, but it inserts the whole path to the
    specified file instead of only the basename.

:AppendPath                                            *:AppendPath*
    Same as |:InsertPath|, but it appends the path after the
    cursor instead of inserting in front of it.

:ChangeEncoding                                    *:ChangeEncoding*
    Directly switch form one encoding into another one. This is
    useful when the targeted text is not UTF-8 encoded. In these
    situations, vve cannot decode the text inside vim and the
    approach of decoding and re-encoding does not work. Instead,
    you can directly switch the encoding using this command.

    ChangeEncoding has to be called from |visualmode| and
    operates on the last visual selection. The following example
    decodes the selected text has hex and re-rencodes it as
    base64.
    >
    :ChangeEncoding hex base64
<

------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Global Mappings                             *vveGlobalMappings*

vve sets up several keymappings for normal and visual mode.
The key combinations for the different mappings are exactly the
same, only the workflow is different. With the visual mode
mappings you select the text to operate on and then invoke the
corresponding mapping. Normal mode mappings, on the other hand,
are invoked in normal mode and switch to operator pending mode
after invocation. This means that they expect a movement
instruction as a follow up action, to define the area of effect.
All of the following key mappings are prefixed with your mapleader
(<leader>).

3. Unprintable Characters                           *vveUnprintable*

Decoding arbitrary portions of text inside of an editor has its
limitations. If the decoded result contains non UTF-8 conform
character codes, the decoding operation might fail. In these
cases, vve will show an error like:
    >
    [Error] - Decoded result cannot be encoded as UTF-8.
<
However, in certain situations working with non UTF-8 data is
desired and vve supports two workarounds to allow it:

                                                 *vveASCII* *vveascii*
*  For (almost) each operation, vve supports an ascii variant.
   In the context of vve ascii encoding basically means that
   ascii characters are displayed as usual, while all other
   characters are displayed as escape sequences.

   As an example, consider you want to decode the following
   base64 encoded value:
   >
   SGVsbG8g/yBXb3JsZA==
<
   Using the ordinary <leader>dB command will fail, as the result
   contains non valid unicode characters. The ascii variant
   (<leader>DB), on the other hand, will decode this to:
   >
   Hello \xff World.
<
                                                 *vveChangeEncoding*
*  A common scenario for dealing with non printable characters is
   when switching encoding. E.g. consider you want to switch from
   the hex encoded string aafefaeac3b1 to its base64 variant.
   Decoding the value with <leader>dh and encoding it with
   <leader>eB will not work, as the decoding operation results in
   non UTF-8 characters.

   To allow such operations, vve supports the |:ChangeEncoding|
   command. Just visual select the hex string aafefaeac3b1 and
   type:
>
   :ChangeEncoding hex base64
<
   The selection should now be encoded as qv766sOx (you can also
   type <leader>ce to open the |:ChangeEncoding| menu).


------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Full Operations                               *vveFullOperations*

vve defines several operations that have the term Full as part of
their name. The meaning of Full slightly differs depending whether
the corresponding operation is an encoding or decoding operation.

*  For encoding operations, Full does basically mean that all
   characters are converted. Using URL encoding as example, the
   string Hello World would normally be encoded as Hello+World, as
   the space character is the only one that really needs to be
   encoded. The Full operation, on the other hand, will encode all
   characters no matter whether encoding is required.

*  For decoding operations, Full operations are basically an
   alternative implementation. Lets take URL encoding again as an
   example. When using the ordinary URL decode operation
   (<leader>du), vve will just use a library function for decoding.
   This is fine for 90% of the cases, but sometimes it causes
   unexpected results.

   As an example: when using the library function to decode %ff to
   ascii representation (<leader>Du), you will get \xef\xbf\xbd.
   This is because the library function tries to apply UTF-8
   encoding, but %ff is no valid UTF-8 format. The Full
   (alternative) implementation (<leader>DU) will decode %ff to
   \xff which is probably what you expect.

In most situation, using the non-Full operations should be fine.
However, when working with non-printable characters, the non-Full
operations can behave unexpected and using Full operations might
fix that.
